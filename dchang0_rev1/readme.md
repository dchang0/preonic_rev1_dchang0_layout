# A custom Preonic layout meant for a single 1U space key that moves backspace/delete and enter to the thumbs,
# separated by the Lower and Raise keys.
#
# This is a somewhat challenging layout to learn if you are already a touch typist in that it will take a while
# to get used to having backspace on your left thumb and enter on your right thumb.
#
# Why move them?
# Two reasons:
#
# a) We're able to add three keys not normally in the Preonic default layout: the _ - (with + = using Lower),
# Right Shift (to make it easier to shift the keys on the left hand), and | \ in the typical locations.
#
# b) This eliminates twisting of the right wrist when reaching for the backspace and enter in the
# default locations. Your fingers almost never stray from the home row except to reach for the top number row.
# The difficulty is that backspace is on the left thumb, which mentally is typically reserved for the spacebar.
# Also, having a 1U space key requires more precision than a single 2U spacebar.
# GUI was swapped with Alt on the left to make overshooting the Backspace with the left thumb less annoying.
#
# c) CAPSLOCK has been added as Raise + Right Shift
#
# This layout includes Qwerty, Dvorak, and Colemak equally well.
# It also has some minor modifications to the Lower and Raise layers to support the changes to the bottom row,
# most notably placing Delete on Lower+Backspace.
